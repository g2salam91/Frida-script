This polished Frida script is a **comprehensive anti-detection bypass tool** designed to **hide root, emulator artifacts, and SSL pinning** on Android devices during dynamic analysis (e.g., reverse engineering, penetration testing, or automated app analysis). It is typically injected into a target Android application at runtime using Frida to **fool root detection, emulator detection, and certificate pinning mechanisms**.

Below is a **detailed breakdown** of what the script does, grouped by functionality:

---

## üîí 1. **Root Detection Bypass**

Root detection is commonly used by apps (especially banking, DRM, or anti-fraud apps) to prevent running on rooted devices.

### üìÅ **File-based Root Checks**
The script hooks multiple file system APIs to **hide known root-related files and directories**, such as:
- `/system/xbin/su`
- `/system/bin/su`
- `/data/adb/magisk`
- `/sbin/.magisk`
- `/system/app/Superuser.apk`
- etc. (see `commonPaths` array)

**Hooks involved:**
- `java.io.File.exists()` ‚Üí returns `false` if the path matches any in `commonPaths`.
- `java.io.UnixFileSystem.checkAccess()` ‚Üí returns `false` for root-related paths.
- Native libc functions:
  - `fopen()` ‚Üí returns `NULL` if trying to open a root-related file.
  - `access()` ‚Üí returns `-1` (file not accessible) for root-related paths.

### üì¶ **Package-based Root Checks**
Many root management apps (e.g., Magisk, SuperSU, KingRoot) install identifiable packages.

**Hooked:**
- `ApplicationPackageManager.getPackageInfo()` ‚Üí if the queried package name is in `ROOTmanagementApp` or the extended `MergedRootPackages` list, it replaces the name with a fake one so the app thinks the package doesn‚Äôt exist.

### üêö **Shell Command Checks**
Apps often execute shell commands like `which su`, `su`, `getprop`, or `mount` to detect root.

**Hooked:**
- `java.lang.Runtime.exec()` (all overloads)
- `java.lang.ProcessImpl.start()`
- `java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start()`

**Behavior:**
- If the command is `su`, `which su`, `mount`, `getprop ro.debuggable`, etc., it **replaces the command** with a harmless one like `grep` or a fake command that will fail silently.
- Prevents the app from detecting the presence of `su` binary or insecure system properties.

### üè∑Ô∏è **System Property Spoofing**
Rooted or debuggable devices often have telltale system properties:
- `ro.debuggable = 1`
- `ro.secure = 0`
- `ro.build.tags = test-keys`

**The script:**
- Uses Java reflection to **override** `Build.TAGS` and `Build.FINGERPRINT`.
- Hooks `SystemProperties.get()` to return safe values (e.g., `ro.debuggable ‚Üí "0"`).
- Hooks native `__system_property_get` in `libc.so` to **intercept and rewrite** property values at the C level.
- Also patches `BufferedReader.readLine()` to **rewrite `test-keys` ‚Üí `release-keys`** if reading `build.prop`.

## üñ•Ô∏è 2. **Emulator Detection Bypass**

Many apps refuse to run on emulators (e.g., Android Studio emulator, Genymotion) to prevent analysis.

### üß™ **Spoofing Device Identity**
The script **overrides Android Build constants** to mimic a real Samsung device:
```js
PRODUCT = "gracerltexx"
MANUFACTURER = "samsung-Pentest1337"
MODEL = "SM-N935F"
FINGERPRINT = "samsung/.../user/release-keys"
```
This makes the app believe it's running on a legitimate Samsung Galaxy Note 8.

### üö´ **Hiding Emulator Artifacts**
Emulators often expose telltale files or processes:
- `/dev/qemu_pipe`
- Files named `qemud`, `cpuinfo` with emulator signatures

**Hooked:**
- `java.io.File.exists()` ‚Üí returns `false` for known emulator-related filenames.

### üì¶ **Hiding Emulator Packages**
Some emulators install diagnostic packages like:
- `com.android.development`
- `com.example.android.apis`

**Hooked:**
- `ApplicationPackageManager.getPackageInfo()` ‚Üí renames these to a fake package so they appear missing.

### üß† **CPU Architecture Spoofing**
Emulators often run on x86/x86_64, while real phones use ARM/ARM64.

**Hooked:**
- Native function `android_getCpuFamily()` ‚Üí if it returns x86/x86_64 (`2` or `5`), it **overrides the return value to ARM64 (`4`)**.

## üîê 3. **SSL/TLS Certificate Pinning Bypass**

Certificate pinning prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by hardcoding expected server certificates. This script disables it to allow traffic interception (e.g., via Burp Suite).

### ‚úÖ **Multiple Pinning Library Bypasses**
It hooks **dozens of common pinning implementations**, including:

| Library / Framework | Hooked Methods |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **OkHttp (v3 & older)** | `CertificatePinner.check()` (4 variants) |
| **TrustKit** | `OkHostnameVerifier.verify()`, `PinningTrustManager.checkServerTrusted()` |
| **Conscrypt (Android‚Äôs TLS stack)** | `TrustManagerImpl.verifyChain()`, `CertPinManager.isChainValid()` |
| **WebView** | `WebViewClient.onReceivedSslError()` ‚Üí auto-proceeds |
| **IBM MobileFirst / Worklight** | `pinTrustedCertificatePublicKey()`, `HostNameVerifierWithCertificatePinning.verify()` |
| **Appcelerator, Cordova, Netty, Squareup, Boye HTTP Client**, etc. | All relevant cert validation methods |

### üõ°Ô∏è **Generic TrustManager Bypass**
- Creates a **custom `X509TrustManager`** that accepts **any certificate**.
- Hooks `SSLContext.init()` to inject this fake trust manager.
- Also hooks `HttpsURLConnection.setHostnameVerifier()` and `setSSLSocketFactory()` to **disable verification**.

### ü§ñ **Automatic Exception Patching**
- Hooks `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` constructor.
- When thrown, it **dynamically identifies the calling method** and **patches it to do nothing**, effectively disabling unknown/custom pinning logic.

---

## üß© Additional Features

- **Stack trace logging** for debugging (`stackTraceHere`, `stackTraceNativeHere`).
- **Memory-safe string handling** when patching native properties.
- **Comprehensive coverage** of both Java and native (libc) layers.
- **Defensive coding**: uses `try/catch` around every hook to avoid crashes if a class/method isn‚Äôt loaded.

---

## üéØ Purpose & Use Case

This script is used by:
- **Security researchers** to analyze apps that employ anti-tampering.
- **Penetration testers** to bypass security controls during mobile app assessments.
- **Malware analysts** to run and observe malicious apps in controlled environments.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Using this on apps you don‚Äôt own or without permission may violate terms of service or laws. Use only in authorized testing.
